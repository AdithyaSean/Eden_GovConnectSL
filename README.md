## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase configuration keys. You can get these from your Firebase project settings.

    ```env
    # Firebase Configuration
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIza..."
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
