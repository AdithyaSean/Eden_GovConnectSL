## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#30475E) to evoke a sense of trust, stability, and authority, aligning with governmental services.
- Background color: Light Grey (#F2F4F7), a very desaturated shade of the primary, offering a clean and modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Subtle Gold (#D4AF37) for highlights, call-to-action buttons, and culturally respectful accents, reflecting Sri Lanka's heritage without overwhelming the UI.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) to ensure optimal readability, essential for accessibility and users with varying levels of digital literacy. 'PT Sans' combines a modern look with a little warmth, personality, and is suitable for headlines or body text
- Use simple, universally recognizable icons that are culturally neutral to aid navigation and enhance usability for all citizens, including those with lower literacy levels.
- Implement a card-based layout to simplify content and make it easily digestible, and to ensure responsiveness across different devices for on-the-go accessibility.
- Use subtle animations to guide the user through interactions and provide feedback. For example, gentle transitions on card selection or form submission, keeping in mind that complex or lengthy animations can hinder usability.
